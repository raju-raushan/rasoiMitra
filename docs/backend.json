    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the Smart Refrigerator web app, focusing on image analysis, recipe suggestions, and empty fridge alerts.  Authorization Independence is achieved by storing Scans under the user's ID, thereby eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules. Each user has their own collection of scans and each scan has a list of associated recipes, which means we are taking advantage of path-based ownership. \n\nThe structure supports required QAPs.  Scans and Recipes are segregated into user-specific subcollections, enabling secure `list` operations as only the authenticated user can access their own scans and recipes. This is achieved via path-based ownership, which makes security rules much easier to reason about and debug. There is no need for membership maps.\n"
